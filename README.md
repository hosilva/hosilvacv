# Hector O. Silva's

I will keep my CV updated in this directory.

Meanwhile, you can check my publication list [here](http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/H.O.Silva.1).

## Question
Why you sign your papers as "Hector O. Silva"?

People from Portuguese speaking languages tend to have long last names. 
For instance, Dom Pedro I, the first emperor of the Brazilian Empire 
(1822 – 1889), full name was:

*Pedro de Alcântara Francisco António João 
Carlos Xavier de Paula Miguel Rafael Joaquim José Gonzaga Pascoal 
Cipriano Serafim* 

My full name is fortunately shorter: Hector Okada da Silva. 
Yet, it causes some confusion, specially the "da" (think of "von" in German or 
"van" in Dutch -- it's the same thing). 
Is it "da Silva", or "Da Silva"? Or "Da silva?". To make everybody's, 
including my own, life easier in academia, I just sign my papers as 
Hector O. Silva as advised by my [father](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vDMTmTgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
