## Question
*Why you sign your papers as "Hector O. Silva"?*

People from Portuguese speaking languages tend to have long last names.
For instance, Dom Pedro I, the first emperor of the Brazilian Empire
(1822 – 1889), full name was:

*Pedro de Alcântara Francisco António João
Carlos Xavier de Paula Miguel Rafael Joaquim José Gonzaga Pascoal
Cipriano Serafim*

My full name is fortunately shorter: Hector Okada da Silva.
Yet, it causes some confusion, specially the "da" (think of "von" in German or
"van" in Dutch -- it's the same thing).
Is it "da Silva", or "Da Silva"? Or "Da silva?". To make everybody's,
including my own, life easier in academia, I just sign my papers as
Hector O. Silva as advised by my [father](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vDMTmTgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
